# GHL-Email-Template-Manager
This is a browser-based GHL Email Template Manager that helps you view and bulk delete email templates from your GoHighLevel subaccount. Since GoHighLevel currently does not offer a native bulk delete option for email templates, this tool uses GHL's official Delete Email Template API to manage and delete templates efficiently.
